Slavery is an ancient abuse, but it still continues in our world today.

## Understanding the Problem

### What is Modern Slavery?
Modern slavery takes many forms.

Labor trafficking happens in the service industries that we participate in on a daily basis, whether it’s the nail salons we visit, the restaurants we patronize, the custodial services we use, and the nursing homes that we are in.

Sex trafficking happens not only on the streets, but it also happens in illicit massage businesses, it happens in residential brothels, and it happens online.

The stark reality is that human trafficking is just as prevalent right here in the San Francisco Bay Area where we live - in our very own neighborhoods.

### How Many are Enslaved?
The total number of slaves around the world is a difficult number to compute because slavery is a crime and a fugitive enterprise. The <a href="http://www.ilo.org">United Nations International Labor Organization (ILO) </a> estimates the figure to be 21 million. But the 2014 edition of the <a href="http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/">Walk Free Global Slavery Index</a> reports that 35.8 million people are enslaved. The ILO estimates about a quarter of the world’s slaves are children. The majority are women and girls.

According to <a href="http://www.kevinbales.net/">Kevin Bales</a>, the co-founder of <a href="http://www.freetheslaves.net/">Free the Slaves</a>, the average price of a human being today, around the world, is about 90 dollars. Slaves are more expensive in places like North America where they cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars, but in places like India or Nepal, human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.[^price-of-slave]

Upon awareness and realization of these facts and figures, we must ask ourselves this same question:

>  [A]re we willing to live in a world with slavery? If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy, and in our government policies. And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on, I think it's that slavery should end. -Kevin Bales

## Being the Solution

### Thinking Globally, Acting Locally
The state of the situation we are in today can be overwhelmingly disheartening at first, but let me encourage you that every thought, deed, prayer, action, and <a href="https://weprovision.com">donation</a> that individuals like you and I make each day makes a world a difference. Our collective action can pave the way for a slave-free Bay Area as we *think global, but act local*.

### Using the Power of Education
Raising public awareness to the realities of human trafficking and modern slavery is the first and most crucial step toward eradicating slavery today. By raising awareness, we can rally our local neighborhoods and communities to collectively and collaboratively work together to abolish slavery right in our own backyards.

For those of us living in the San Francisco Bay Area, we can support local nonprofit organizations like the <a href="http://www.baatc.org/">Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Coalition (BAATC)</a> who *equips and engages individuals, civic groups, and non-profits with best practices to sustain in the fight against human trafficking in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.* The BAATC works to build collaboration between local non-profits to establish a stronger continuum of care among victim service providers, and educate activists about how to sustain in their continuum of engagement to intervene on behalf of those who are enslaved.[^baatc]
