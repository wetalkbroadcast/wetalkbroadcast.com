I was filming interviews with the <a href="http://instagram.com/wemassmedia">@wemassmedia</a> crew at <a href="http://www.tbc.city/">TBC's</a> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tbc-large-group-gathering-51416-tickets-20743383017">Large Group Gathering in Oakland on May 14, 2016</a>.

I had the opportunity to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougtegner">Doug Tegner</a>, the Pastor at Large of <a href="http://www.redwoodchapel.org/">Redwood Chapel Community Church</a>, and Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.youthworkers.net/">National Network of Youth Ministries (NNYM)</a>

I really enjoyed hearing from Doug about his 30-year career in building and synergizing local and national networks of youth, youth ministries, pastors, schools, and churches. Doug gave me a fresh perspective on connecting with others outside of my normal streams that I have been a part of through trusted relationships.

# Interview with Doug Tegner

**Justin**: Glad to have you with us today, Doug.

**Doug**: Great to be here.

**Justin**: SO tell me a little bit about yourself.

**Doug**: My name is Doug, and I grew up at Redwood Chapel in Castro Valley as a junior high kid and high school kid. And I met the Lord there and grew in the faith in the Lord there. Eventually, I became the youth pastor at Redwood Chapel and was married there as well.

After 12 years of youth pastor work, we ended up working with partnerships around the country in youth ministries. So we started a lot of networks throughout the United States and the Bay Area, and I've been doing community partnership work for quite a few years.

And so my home church called me to be the senior pastor nine years ago.

**Justin**: That's fantastic. Tell me a little bit about these youth networks that you guys are apart of - that sounds really interesting.

**Doug**: So about 20 years ago, I started a couple local, youth pastor networks in the Bay Area - in the East Bay. It grew to about five, placed throughout the South Bay and East Bay starting in the mid-90's. And they kind of flourished.

I was asked to be the National Director for the National Network of Youth Ministries. So based out of San Diego, we help start networks both on a local level and also on a city-wide level, and eventually, national level, of youth partnerships in youth ministries.

It has been a joy to see the body of Christ come together and work. We have rural networks, urban networks, Native American networks, and then especially, local networks in communities all over America.

**Justin**: So how do these networks work?

**Doug**: So every local network has its own indigenous mission. Evangelism and prayer have always been the primary two things, but justice and social justice and compassion - have also become a third arm, I guess you could say, of most youth pastor networks. And we see it going on as I become a senior pastor. We see senior pastors have a lot of networks, as well, with my 30 year history with youth ministry, in particular.

We come together, usually by one or two people who have a vision to work humbly together, value each other, and seeing the greater good of the Kingdom of God advancing without seeing one church dominating, or one person dominating, the environment.

So by that humble leadership, by facilitating people to partner together, and getting to know each other through relationship, often with prayer or caring for each others' lives, personally, and their families. There's a trust that's built in the community - the fabric of the community - and then I think out of that trust and prayerful relationships can come a cohesion of projects or events or ongoing strategies that emerge. But those start with, I think, trusted relationships first.

**Justin**: So how can other Christian youth, or churches, get involved with these networks?

**Doug**: Well, most local networks have their own website, or Facebook page, or something like that. But there is a national conglomerate, so to speak, on a national website, youthworkers.net, where they can find networks around the country based on most metro areas. There's also a website, everyschool.com, which has every school on America listed on it. And there's a lot of partnerships around local schools.

So local churches, local prayer church groups, Youth for Christ, Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), Young Life, et cetera, will adopt a school and the adoptions are listed on this one website. So then you can find each other, and working together, around a certain school, or of course, just in fellowship in the community.

So everyschool.com or youthworkers.net are the two main sites that we have to do that on a national level, but really it's down to the local level of every community.

**Justin**: Yes, that's fantastic. I think the whole notion of local... collaboration that's a really great synergy, I think.

So TBC is trying to connect a lot of those kinds of things, as well, and it's really exciting to bring together the local leadership, such as yourself, that are doing these kinds of things and giving these opportunities to the wider community.

So you've been involved with TBC for how long now?

**Doug**: About two and a half years. I've been to most of the quarterly gatherings. I've missed a couple, but it has been a real privilege and joy to be here whenever I know the Large Gathering is taking place.

What have you found the benefits have been from your perspective in attending these kinds of events, and the people that you get to meet?

**Doug**: Well, just like today, I think the presents they have every time have been a home run - in terms of awaking my own conscience. I'm always challenged - my heart gets pricked a little bit with some issues that are raised from every one of these meetings.

So for one thing, for my own personal growth, as a senior pastor, and now as a pastor at large. Sometimes you don't get enough, I guess you could say, fresh input contextualized to your role. You're always giving, or leading, or preparing for others.

So this has been a feeding time for me, first of all.

But I love the relationships here. It has been great to get to know the cross-pollination of the Body of Christ in the Bay Area. And so whether it's the city suburbs, para-church, local church, gender, age - there's a cross pollinating going on that's always refreshing to me, personally.

I meet some people, new. I get to reconnect with others. And there's a sense of, I think, growing a shared mission that kind of comes out of our times together.

I think we would like to be more aggressive in knowing what to do next, but I think we're getting there.

**Justin**: That's really cool. So you touched on this idea of cross-pollination amongst churches - what would you say, as words of encouragement, or a word of challenge, to churches that aren't quite there yet, not quite there collaborating in the wider network? How can another senior pastor, or a leadership team, at another church - how can they take that step to get plugged into the wider community?

**Doug**: You know, it takes a great risk from a pastor - let's say a senior pastor - leaving the confines and comfort - the boundaries - his church has or her church has - into stepping into other relationships or even other slightly different theological positions that they might hold themselves.

I think there's a fear that can be in many senior leadership, or just a sense of obligation to just to make sure their church grows and their church is being served. But I think there's something really freeing about seeing the Kingdom of God wider than your own structure that you're in.

I've been really challenged in the later years of my ministry with how the Kingdom of God is advancing. Jesus called us to the Kingdom, not to our church structure. I love the local church. Many churches have denominational structures, but I think that the Kingdom of God is much wider than we think it is.

Even though we have a theological - a conservative theological position - in holding to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Scriptures, the Gospel of Christ on the Cross, and Salvation by faith alone. Even within that dedication, there's a lot wider, diverse ways that God is moving today and has been moving. I think we're just becoming more awakened to it.

So I think it's a freshening that can happen for any senior pastor to appropriately connect with others outside of their normal streams that they have been a part of.

**Justin**: fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing all these fresh perspectives with us. I feel encouraged. Thanks for all the work that you do. We look forward to having more conversations with you in the future. Thanks a lot Doug.

**Doug**: Thanks, Justin.
