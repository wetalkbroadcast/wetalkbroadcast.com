I was filming interviews with the <a href="instagram.com/wemassmedia">@wemassmedia</a> crew at <a href="http://www.tbc.city/">TBC's</a> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tbc-large-group-gathering-51416-tickets-20743383017">Large Group Gathering in Oakland on May 14, 2016</a>.

To my delight, I realized that <a href="https://twitter.com/echojustice">Regina Evans</a> of <a href="http://www.reginasdoor.com/">Regina's Door</a> was also at the event through a Facebook post that popped up on my Timeline from <a href="https://twitter.com/nederdave">Dave Nederhood</a>.

I immediately messaged Regina to see if I could snag a moment of her time for a quick chat. She had to run off to her next event, but was kind enough to stop by our interview set for a few minutes first to have a candid chat with me.

# Interview with Regina Evans

**Justin**: Great to have you here at the TBC Large Group Gathering. What brings you here today?

**Regina**: I just did a spoken word piece, called "This is My Land," on Oakland.

**Justin**: That's so awesome. Tell me a little bit about that.

**Regina**: I just did a piece looking back into the ancestral flow of who I am, and the movements that have been birthed out of here by people of color, the great monuments that have been built, the music that has been made, the educational endeavors -- and, you know, continuing to honor that. Honoring the past, and then having that passed down. Having people come here and remembering to honor that. There are a lot of great things in life being birthed out of this city and in the foundation of this city. And it needs to be honored as people come.

**Justin**: That's so beautiful, Regina. Okay, tell us a little bit about Regina's Door.

**Regina**: Regina's Door is a social enterprise - a vintage boutique, located in Oakland.

**Justin**: How can somebody get involved with all that you are doing.

<!-- more -->

**Regina**: Well, give me a call, send me an email. I always need people to come in and help man the store, come and be in relationship with my community - that's the main thing. I have so many people - young people - that come in and they have a ton of needs and also they need wisdom. They need to learn how to maneuver in this world, and they need love, they need the support of their elders. And so, if I were to say anything, that's one of the biggest things. The biggest cry of my heart is to run up for youth, to be there, to be present.

You know, we talk about relationship and getting to know people, but you can't do that unless you're up front for them. And you know, just sit, having a meal. Checking on them: *how are you?* I'm with them everyday. I know their pains, I know their joys, their sorrows, their successes, and that's how community grows, and that's how it flourishes. It doesn't otherwise.

Also, we need stock. So if anybody wants to donate some beautiful vintage, that's another thing that we need as well. But mainly, we need people to join us and to love on the youth that serve in the store.

**Justin**: I love that Regina, so well put. Thanks for spending some time with us. We are looking forward to continuing the conversation, and learning more about all that you do, and how we might be able to get connected.
